# Ardi Agent Frontend Design: Task Management Application

This document details the frontend design and implementation simulation for a task management web application.  The application will allow users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.  It will feature a clean, modern interface with intuitive interactions.

## I. UI/UX Design

The application will employ a clean, minimalist design using a light color palette with subtle accents.  The typography will be clear and legible, using a sans-serif font like Roboto or Open Sans.  The layout will be responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.

**Homepage:** The homepage will display a list of tasks, organized by status (incomplete, complete). Each task will show its title, description (truncated if long), due date, and a checkbox for marking completion.  A "Add New Task" button will be prominently placed.

**Task Details View:** Clicking on a task will open a detailed view, allowing editing of the task title, description, and due date.  Buttons for "Save Changes," "Delete Task," and "Cancel" will be available.

**Color Palette:**  #f4f4f4 (background), #333 (text), #4CAF50 (complete task), #FF5722 (due date warning).

**Animations:**  Subtle animations will be used for transitions (e.g., task completion checkmark).

## II. Implementation Simulation

This section outlines the frontend implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**A. HTML Structure:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Ardi Task Manager</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Ardi Task Manager</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section id="task-list">
      <!-- Task list items will be dynamically added here -->
    </section>
    <button id="add-task-button">Add New Task</button>
  </main>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**B. CSS Styling:**

CSS will utilize Flexbox and Grid for layout, ensuring responsiveness across devices.  Animations will be implemented using CSS transitions and keyframes.  The color palette and typography will be applied to ensure a consistent and visually appealing design.


**C. JavaScript Interactivity:**

JavaScript will handle dynamic task creation, editing, deletion, and marking tasks as complete.  It will interact with a simulated backend API (details below) to manage data persistence.

```javascript
// Sample JavaScript function to add a new task
function addNewTask(taskTitle, taskDescription, taskDueDate) {
  // Simulated API call
  fetch('/api/tasks', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ title: taskTitle, description: taskDescription, dueDate: taskDueDate })
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Update UI with new task
  });
}
```

**D. API Integration:**

The frontend will interact with a simulated backend API for data management.  The API endpoints will be:

* `/api/tasks`:  GET (retrieve all tasks), POST (add new task)
* `/api/tasks/{id}`: GET (retrieve single task), PUT (update task), DELETE (delete task)


## III. Documentation

This design prioritizes usability and a modern aesthetic, leveraging best practices in web development.  The responsive design ensures accessibility on various devices.  The minimalist approach enhances clarity and focus.
