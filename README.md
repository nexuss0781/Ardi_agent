# Ardi Agent: An Autonomous AI Development System

![Ardi Agent Logo Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Ardi+Agent+Logo)

Ardi Agent is an advanced Agentic AI system designed to streamline the development lifecycle of web applications, from initial concept to implementation and testing. It leverages a multi-agent architecture to autonomously handle tasks across backend, frontend, and full-stack development.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Autonomous Workflow Orchestration:** A central orchestrator dynamically manages the flow between specialized AI agents, ensuring a clear and efficient development path.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash Integration:** Utilizes Google's powerful Gemini 2.5 Flash model for all Large Language Model (LLM) interactions, providing consistent and high-quality AI capabilities.
*   **Comprehensive Session History:** Tracks all LLM interactions and agent actions, enabling context-aware operations, task resumption, and detailed post-mortem analysis.
*   **Robust Agent Implementations:** Features enhanced `ClarificationAgent`, `DebuggingAgent`, and `QualityAssuranceAgent` for more reliable and actionable insights.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** Securely manages API keys and other sensitive information via a `.env` file.

## 🚀 How It Works

Ardi Agent operates through a series of interconnected phases, each driven by a team of specialized AI agents. The workflow is orchestrated to ensure a logical progression from understanding a user's query to delivering a comprehensive development plan and simulated implementation.

### Phase 1: Query Processing & Planning
This phase focuses on deeply understanding the user's request and formulating a detailed development roadmap.

*   **Language Expert:** Refines and formalizes the initial user query.
*   **Clarification Agent:** Identifies and seeks clarification on ambiguous or missing objectives, ensuring a solid foundation for development.
*   **Idea Generator:** Brainstorms and outlines comprehensive feature sets for the application.
*   **Analysis Agent:** Conducts simulated market research, trend analysis, and competitor assessment to inform feature development.
*   **Synthesizer Agent:** Integrates ideas and analysis into a cohesive, structured document.
*   **Quality Assurance Agent:** Reviews content at critical junctures, providing feedback for refinement.
*   **Report Agent:** Generates a detailed pre-implementation roadmap.
*   **Organizer Agent:** Structures and beautifies generated content for clarity and readability.
*   **Presenter Agent:** Summarizes the completed planning phase and prepares for implementation.

### Phase 2: Implementation & Validation
This phase translates the development plan into a simulated implementation, focusing on backend, frontend, and integration aspects.

*   **Tasker Agent:** Categorizes features into distinct backend and frontend development tasks.
*   **Backend Expert:** Simulates the development of the application's backend components.
*   **Frontend Expert:** Simulates the development of the application's user interface and experience.
*   **Fullstack Expert:** Verifies the integrity and compatibility of the integrated backend and frontend components.
*   **Report Agent:** Generates post-implementation documentation and summaries.
*   **Synthesizer Agent:** Consolidates post-implementation reports and insights.
*   **Organizer Agent:** Formats and beautifies the final documentation.
*   **Debugging Agent:** Identifies and suggests solutions for simulated technical issues.
*   **Presenter Agent:** Delivers a comprehensive overview of the completed implementation phase.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nexuss0781/Ardi_agent.git
    cd Ardi_agent
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is not currently present but should be created to list all Python dependencies like `python-dotenv` and `google-generativeai`.)*

3.  **Configure API Key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Gemini API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual Gemini API key.

## ▶️ Usage

To run the Ardi Agent, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python3.11 main.py
```

The orchestrator will initiate the development workflow based on a predefined initial query. Progress and outputs will be displayed in the terminal, and detailed session history will be saved in the `sessions/` directory.
