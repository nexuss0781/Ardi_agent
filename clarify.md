Okay, I understand you need a web-based application for task management, supporting basic CRUD operations (Create, View, Update, Delete) for tasks, and tracking task status and due dates. This is a clear starting point.

To ensure we build exactly what you need, I have some clarifying questions. Think of me as your development team trying to get all the necessary details before we start coding.

Let's begin with some fundamental aspects:

1.  **User Management & Access:**
    *   Will this application be for a single user, or will multiple users need to access it?
    *   If multiple users, will they share tasks, or will each user have their own private tasks?
    *   Is user authentication (e.g., login/password) required? If so, any specific requirements for it (e.g., social logins, email verification)?
    *   Do we need different user roles or permissions (e.g., admin, regular user)?

2.  **Task Attributes & Details:**
    *   Beyond "status" and "due date," what other essential attributes should a task have? (e.g., title/name, description, priority, assigned user, creation date, completion date, tags/categories, attachments?)
    *   What are the possible values for "status"? (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done, Blocked?)
    *   How flexible should the due date be? (e.g., just a date, or time as well?)

3.  **Task Organization & Views:**
    *   How do users typically want to view their tasks? (e.g., a simple list, a calendar view, Kanban board, grouped by status/due date/priority?)
    *   Will tasks need to be organized into projects, lists, or other hierarchical structures?
    *   Are there any filtering, sorting, or search capabilities required for tasks?

Please provide as much detail as you can for these points. Once we clarify these, we can move on to other areas like notifications, reporting, and non-functional requirements.

**Internal `todo.md` (updated based on initial request):**
*   [ ] Clarify user authentication/authorization requirements (single vs. multi-user, shared tasks, roles).
*   [ ] Define core task attributes beyond status and due date (e.g., title, description, priority, tags, attachments).
*   [ ] Specify possible values for "status" and "due date" format.
*   [ ] Understand task organization/categorization needs (projects, lists, hierarchy).
*   [ ] Determine required task views (list, calendar, Kanban) and filtering/sorting/search capabilities.
*   [ ] Identify reporting/notification requirements (future).
*   [ ] Identify non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security, UI/UX) (future).
*   [ ] Discuss technology preferences (future).
*   [ ] Clarify deployment strategy (future).
