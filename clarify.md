Understood. You need a web application for comprehensive task management with standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities.

Before we proceed with development, I need to clarify some crucial aspects to ensure we build exactly what you envision and avoid rework. Think of me as your lead developer, gathering all the necessary details.

Here are my initial clarification questions:

---

**`todo.md` (Internal Tracking):**
- [ ] Clarify user management (single vs. multi-user, authentication).
- [ ] Clarify data persistence (how and where tasks are stored).
- [ ] Clarify specific task attributes (e.g., `status` states, `due date` precision, other attributes).
- [ ] Clarify viewing options (sorting, filtering, pagination).
- [ ] Clarify technology stack preferences.
- [ ] Clarify UI/UX expectations (e.g., responsiveness, specific frameworks).

**Clarification Questions:**

1.  **User Management:**
    *   Is this application intended for a **single user** only, or will multiple users need to create and manage their own tasks independently?
    *   If multiple users, will there be a need for **user registration, login, and authentication**?

2.  **Data Persistence:**
    *   How should the tasks be stored? For example, should they be stored in a **database** (e.g., SQL like PostgreSQL/MySQL, or NoSQL like MongoDB)? Or is a simpler solution like **browser local storage** acceptable for a proof-of-concept?

3.  **Task Attributes & Details:**
    *   For the `due date`, do we need to specify a **time** component, or is just the date sufficient? Are there any timezone considerations?
    *   Regarding `status`, you mentioned "complete or incomplete." Are there any other potential statuses a task could have (e.g., "in progress," "pending," "archived")?
    *   Are there any **other attributes** you foresee for a task, such as priority (high, medium, low), tags/categories, or reminders?

4.  **Viewing Tasks:**
    *   When viewing the list of all tasks, should there be options to **sort** them (e.g., by due date, creation date, title, status)?
    *   Will users need to **filter** tasks (e.g., show only complete tasks, tasks due this week, tasks with a specific tag)?
    *   For a large number of tasks, is **pagination** (showing tasks in pages) or infinite scrolling desired?

5.  **Technology Stack:**
    *   Do you have any preferences for the **front-end framework/library** (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js, vanilla JavaScript)?
    *   Do you have any preferences for the **back-end language/framework** (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails, PHP/Laravel)?

Please provide as much detail as possible for these questions. Once I have this information, I can update our `clarify.md` document and proceed with a more detailed plan.
