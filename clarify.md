Understood. As your Clarification Agent, I'm here to ensure we capture all necessary details for your task management web application.

Please elaborate on the following points to help formalize your request and establish a precise scope:

---

### **1. Core Functionality:**

*   **Task Creation:** What essential fields should a task include (e.g., title, description, due date, priority level, status, assignee)?
*   **Task Viewing:** How should tasks be displayed (e.g., a simple list, a calendar view, a Kanban board, grouped by category/status, a combination)?
*   **Task Editing:** Confirm if the ability to modify *all* task details is required.
*   **Task Deletion:** Confirm if the ability to remove tasks is required.
*   **Task Status Management:** What are the specific possible statuses for a task (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed, Pending, Blocked, On Hold, Canceled)?

### **2. User Management & Scope:**

*   Is this application intended for a **single user**, or will it support **multiple users**?
*   If multiple users, will **user authentication** (login/logout, registration) be required?
*   Will users need to **share tasks** or collaborate on projects within the application? If so, how (e.g., assign tasks to others, shared projects)?

### **3. Advanced Features (Optional but common):**

*   **Categorization/Tagging:** Ability to organize tasks using categories, tags, or projects.
*   **Search & Filtering:** Ability to search for tasks and filter them by various criteria (e.g., status, due date, priority, category, assignee, creation date).
*   **Sorting:** Ability to sort tasks (e.g., by due date, priority, creation date, title).
*   **Reminders/Notifications:** Should the application provide reminders for upcoming or overdue tasks (e.g., in-app, email, push notifications)?
*   **Subtasks/Checklists:** Ability to break down tasks into smaller, manageable sub-components.
*   **Recurring Tasks:** Ability to set tasks that repeat automatically (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, custom intervals)?
*   **Attachments:** Ability to attach files or links to tasks.
*   **Reporting/Analytics:** Any need for summaries, progress tracking, or analytics on task completion and user productivity?

### **4. User Interface & Experience (UI/UX):**

*   Are there any specific design preferences, desired aesthetics, or existing task management applications that serve as inspiration (e.g., Trello, Asana, Todoist, Monday.com)?
*   Should the application be **responsive** (optimized for various devices like desktops, tablets, and mobile phones)?

Please provide as much detail as possible for each point. Your answers will directly shape the project's scope and subsequent development. I'll update our internal `todo.md` as we address each item and compile the final `clarify.md` once we have a comprehensive understanding.
