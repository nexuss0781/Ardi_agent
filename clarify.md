## Clarified Objectives for Task Management Web Application

**Core Functionality Confirmed:**
*   **Task Creation:** Ability to add new tasks.
*   **Task Viewing:** Ability to display a list of all tasks.
*   **Task Editing:** Ability to modify existing task details.
*   **Task Deletion:** Ability to remove tasks.
*   **Task Attributes:** Each task will support the following attributes:
    *   **Title:** A concise name for the task (mandatory).
    *   **Description:** Detailed information about the task (optional).
    *   **Status:** An indicator of the task's current state.
    *   **Due Date:** A specific date by which the task should be completed (optional).
*   **User Interface:** A browser-accessible graphical user interface (GUI) to perform all task management operations.
*   **Data Persistence:** Tasks and their attributes will be stored persistently using a database backend.

**Further Clarifications:**
1.  **Task Statuses:** The required statuses for the initial version are: 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Completed', 'Blocked', 'On Hold'. The default status for a newly created task will be 'To Do'. Custom statuses are not required for now.
2.  **User Interface (GUI):** The design preference is clean, modern, and minimalist. The application should be fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
3.  **Database Technology:** PostgreSQL is the preferred database technology.
4.  **Multi-user Support (Future-Proofing):** The initial database schema and application architecture should be designed with multi-user support in mind to facilitate future expansion.
