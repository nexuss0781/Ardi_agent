# Simulated Dialogue to Clarify Requirements

# Clarification Agent:  "Let's clarify the requirements for this task management web application. First, who is the target audience for this application?"

# Orchestrator: "The target audience is project managers and team members within a small to medium-sized company."

# Clarification Agent: "Okay, thank you.  Next, could you please elaborate on the comprehensiveness of the application?  Are we aiming for something simple, or a more extensive system?"

# Orchestrator:  "We need a moderately comprehensive system.  It should handle most aspects of project task management but doesn't need extremely advanced features."

# Clarification Agent: "Understood. To be more specific, could you list the absolute essential features, as well as any 'nice-to-have' features?"

# Orchestrator: "Essential features: user authentication, task creation, assignment, due dates, and status updates. Nice-to-have: task prioritization, simple reporting (e.g., tasks overdue), and basic collaboration features (commenting on tasks)."

# Clarification Agent: "Great.  Are there any preferences or constraints regarding the technology stack?"

# Orchestrator: "We're flexible, but we prefer a modern JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js, and a scalable database solution like PostgreSQL."

# Clarification Agent: "Finally, regarding the UI/UX, are there any specific design guidelines, branding requirements, or user experience expectations?"

# Orchestrator: "We want a clean, intuitive interface.  No specific branding guidelines yet."

# Clarification Agent:  "Thank you. We've addressed the ambiguities in the original query."
