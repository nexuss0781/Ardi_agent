Thank you for initiating this request and for providing such a comprehensive initial outline of clarification points. This is an excellent starting point for ensuring we build exactly what you need.

I understand the core requirement is to develop a **web-based application for task management**.

To proceed with the design and development phases, we need to gather specific details on the ambiguities you've highlighted. Please elaborate on each of the following points:

---

### **1. Task Definition & Attributes:**
*   What essential attributes should a task possess (e.g., title, description, due date, priority level, status (e.g., 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Completed'))?
*   Are there any other required fields (e.g., category/tagging, estimated time, assigned user)?
*   Is support for subtasks or hierarchical task structures necessary?
*   Are recurring tasks a required feature?

### **2. User Management & Collaboration:**
*   Will the application be for a single user, or is multi-user support with user accounts (registration, login, authentication) needed?
*   If multi-user, is task assignment to different users or collaborative task management (e.g., sharing task lists, commenting) required?

### **3. Core Management Functionalities (CRUD+):**
*   **Creation:** How should new tasks be added (e.g., simple form, quick add)?
*   **Viewing/Listing:** How should tasks be displayed (e.g., list view, calendar view, Kanban board, Gantt chart)? What filtering, sorting, and search capabilities are needed (e.g., by due date, priority, status, category, assignee)?
*   **Updating:** How should task attributes be modified?
*   **Deletion:** How should tasks be removed?
*   Are additional actions like task completion, archiving, deferring, or restoring required?

### **4. Notifications & Reminders:**
*   Are notifications (e.g., email, in-app, push) for due dates, task assignments, or status changes required?

### **5. Data Persistence:**
*   How should task data be stored (e.g., local storage for a simple single-user app, a database for multi-user or complex data)?

### **6. User Interface & Experience:**
*   Are there any specific UI/UX preferences (e.g., minimalist, highly visual, mobile-responsive, specific design language)?
*   Is drag-and-drop functionality desired for task reordering or status changes?

### **7. Scope & Priority:**
*   Is this intended as a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) with core functionalities, or a comprehensive, feature-rich solution?
*   What are the absolute must-have features versus nice-to-have features for an initial release?

Please provide as much detail as possible for each point. Once you provide answers, I will update our internal `todo.md` and begin populating the `clarify.md` document with the confirmed requirements.
