# Ardi Agent: Unified Design Document 

This document synthesizes the backend and frontend designs for the Ardi Agent application‚Äîa web application featuring a note-taking system and a task management system. üéâ

## I. Backend Design (Note-Taking System)

The backend uses a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) with two tables: `users` and `notes`. The `users` table stores user information (username, email, securely hashed password). The `notes` table stores user notes, linking to `users` via a foreign key (`user_id`).

**Database Schema:**

*   **users:** `user_id` (INT, PK, AI), `username` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL), `password_hash` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL), `email` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP), `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
*   **notes:** `note_id` (INT, PK, AI), `user_id` (INT, FK referencing users.user_id), `title` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL), `content` (TEXT), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP), `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

**API Endpoints (RESTful, JSON):**

*   **Users:**
    *   `/users/register` (POST): Register a new user.
    *   `/users/login` (POST): Authenticate an existing user. JWT issued upon success. ‚úÖ
    *   `/users/me` (GET): Retrieve currently logged-in user's information (requires authentication).

*   **Notes:**
    *   `/notes` (GET): Retrieve all notes for the currently logged-in user (requires authentication).
    *   `/notes` (POST): Create a new note (requires authentication).
    *   `/notes/{note_id}` (GET): Retrieve a specific note (requires authentication).
    *   `/notes/{note_id}` (PUT): Update a specific note (requires authentication).
    *   `/notes/{note_id}` (DELETE): Delete a specific note (requires authentication).


**Authentication/Authorization:** JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. Passwords are hashed using a strong one-way algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). üîí

**Business Logic:** Includes password hashing, JWT generation/validation, data validation/sanitization, and CRUD operations for notes with error handling and logging.

**Security & Scalability:** HTTPS, input validation, parameterized queries, secure password storage, database indexing/optimization, load balancing, and caching will be implemented to ensure security and scalability. Error handling uses standard HTTP status codes with detailed error messages in the response body.


## II. Frontend Design (Task Management System)

The frontend is a task management application integrated with the note-taking backend for a cohesive user experience.

**UI/UX Design:** Clean, minimalist design with:

*   Light color palette (#f4f4f4 background, #333 text, #4CAF50 complete task, #FF5722 due date warning)
*   Legible sans-serif font (Roboto or Open Sans)
*   Responsive layout
*   Subtle animations ‚ú®

*   **Homepage:** Displays tasks organized by status (incomplete/complete), showing title, description (truncated), due date, and a completion checkbox. Includes an "Add New Task" button. ‚ûï
*   **Task Details View:** Allows editing task details (title, description, due date) with "Save Changes," "Delete Task," and "Cancel" buttons.


**Implementation Simulation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):** Uses Flexbox and Grid for layout, CSS transitions/keyframes for animations. JavaScript handles dynamic task management and interacts with the backend API.

**API Integration:** The frontend interacts with the backend API using these endpoints:

*   `/api/tasks` (GET, POST): Retrieve/add tasks.
*   `/api/tasks/{id}` (GET, PUT, DELETE): Retrieve/update/delete tasks.


## III. Synergy and Future Opportunities

Integrating note-taking and task management offers significant synergy! Users can seamlessly associate notes with tasks. ü§ù Future development could include:

*   **Task-Note Linking:** Allow users to link notes to specific tasks.
*   **Advanced Search/Filtering:** Implement more sophisticated search and filtering. üîé
*   **Collaboration Features:** Allow multiple users to collaborate. üë•
*   **Calendar Integration:** Integrate with a calendar application. üìÖ
*   **Notification System:** Implement a notification system for deadlines. üîî


This unified design provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive and user-friendly Ardi Agent application. The integrated note-taking and task management systems offer a powerful and versatile tool for users!
