## Ardi Agent Project Todo List

### Phase 1: Initialize Git Repository and Upload Files
- [x] Set up Git user name
- [x] Set up Git user email
- [x] Create project directory `ardi_agent`
- [x] Initialize Git repository in `ardi_agent`
- [x] Move `ArdiAgent.md` to `ardi_agent` directory
- [x] Create `todo.md` file
- [x] Add `todo.md` to Git
- [x] Add `ArdiAgent.md` to Git
- [ ] Commit initial files
- [ ] Push to GitHub repository

### Phase 2: Plan the Application Architecture and Development
- [ ] Analyze `ArdiAgent.md` for detailed requirements
- [ ] Design the overall architecture of the Agentic AI system
- [ ] Outline the interaction flow between different agents
- [ ] Define data structures for inter-agent communication
