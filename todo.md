- [x] Debug and fix any identified issues
- [x] Optimize code for performance and resource usage

### Phase 8: Final Commit and Deliver Outcome
- [x] Ensure all code is well-documented
- [x] Final review of the project structure and files
- [x] Create a comprehensive `README.md`
- [x] Final commit to Git repository
- [x] Push all changes to GitHub
- [x] Provide final output and instructions to the user
