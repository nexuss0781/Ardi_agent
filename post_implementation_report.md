This document outlines the roadmap for implementing the Ardi Agent system based on the analysis in `Synthesis.md`.

## Phase 1: Backend Development (4 weeks)

**Milestones:**
* Database schema design and implementation.
* Core API endpoint development (CRUD operations for notes).
* User authentication and authorization implementation (JWT).
* Unit testing of backend components.

**Technology Stack:**
* Programming Language: Python (with Flask or Django framework)
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Testing Framework: pytest

## Phase 2: Frontend Development (3 weeks)

**Milestones:**
* UI/UX design and prototyping.
* Frontend development using React.js (or similar framework).
* Integration with the backend API.
* Unit and integration testing of frontend components.

**Technology Stack:**
* Programming Language: JavaScript
* Framework: React.js
* State Management: Redux (or similar)

## Phase 3: Full-Stack Integration and Testing (2 weeks)

**Milestones:**
* End-to-end testing of the application.
* Deployment to a staging environment.
* Performance testing and optimization.
* Bug fixing and refinement.

**Technology Stack:**
* Deployment Platform: AWS, Google Cloud, or similar.


## Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring (1 week)


**Milestones:**
* Deployment to production environment.
* Monitoring and performance optimization.
* Documentation updates.


**Overall Technology Stack Summary:**

* **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django), PostgreSQL, pytest
* **Frontend:** JavaScript, React.js, Redux (optional)
* **Deployment:** AWS/GCP/Azure (Choice based on cost and scalability requirements)
* **Version Control:** Git (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)

This roadmap is a high-level overview and may be adjusted based on the development process.  Detailed tasks and sub-tasks will be defined in subsequent project planning documentation.

This document summarizes the implemented features of the Ardi Agent system.

## Implemented Features:

Based on the backend, frontend, and integration reports, the following features have been implemented:

{backend_summary}
{frontend_summary}
{fullstack_integration_report}


## Technical Specifications:

* **Backend:**  [Insert detailed backend specifications based on backend_summary.md - database schema, API endpoints, authentication details etc.]
* **Frontend:**  [Insert detailed frontend specifications based on frontend_summary.md - UI framework, technologies used etc.]
* **Database:** PostgreSQL [Add version number]
* **API:** RESTful API


## Future Considerations:

The following items are identified as areas for improvement or future development:
* [List items based on fullstack_report.md, backend_summary.md, and frontend_summary.md]
