# Ardi_agent Development Roadmap: Addressing Robustness and Production Readiness

This document outlines a detailed action plan to address the non-robust features, partially implemented functionalities, and identified bottlenecks in the `Ardi_agent` codebase, moving towards a production-ready multi-agent system.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Orchestration Enhancement

### 1.1 Workflow and Orchestration Refinement

-   [ ] **Centralized Task Management**: Implement a `task_manager.py` or `orchestrator.py` module to manage the overall task, break it down into sub-tasks, and assign them to appropriate agents dynamically.
-   [ ] **Agent Registry**: Develop a mechanism for agents to register their capabilities, allowing the orchestrator to dynamically select agents based on task requirements.
-   [ ] **Event-Driven Architecture (Initial)**: Introduce a basic event system where agents can publish completion events, and the orchestrator can subscribe to these to trigger subsequent actions, reducing tight coupling.
-   [ ] **Shared Context/Memory (Initial)**: Implement a shared `Context` object that agents can access to read and write relevant information, facilitating better collaboration.

### 1.2 LLM Consistency and Token Management

-   [ ] **Dedicated Gemini Integration**: Create a `llm_client.py` module that uses the Google Gemini API client library directly, centralizing all LLM interactions and ensuring consistent model usage (Gemini 2.5 Flash).
-   [ ] **Centralized API Key Management**: Implement `.env` file support for storing API keys. Develop a configuration loader to securely read these variables.
-   [ ] **Remove OpenAI Dependency**: Systematically replace all `from openai import OpenAI` imports and related code with the new Gemini integration.
-   [ ] **Robust Error Handling for API Calls**: Implement comprehensive error handling for LLM API calls, including retries with exponential backoff and clear logging for rate limits or authentication failures.

### 1.3 Session History and Agent Memory

-   [ ] **Centralized Session Management**: Implement a `SessionManager` module responsible for logging all LLM interactions (prompt, response, model, timestamp) and significant agent actions (inputs, outputs).
-   [ ] **Persistent Storage for History**: Store the session history persistently (e.g., in a structured log file or a dedicated directory of JSON/YAML files) to allow for retrieval and analysis after restarts.
-   [ ] **Shared Context Object Enhancement**: Expand the shared `Context` object to include current task state, intermediate results, and agent-specific memory, accessible to all agents.
-   [ ] **Basic Checkpointing Mechanism**: Implement a basic checkpointing system to periodically save the state of the `SessionManager` and `Context` object, enabling resumption from the last successful point.

## Phase 2: Robust Feature Implementation & Agent Autonomy

### 2.1 Robust Implementation of Placeholders

-   [ ] **Robust `ClarificationAgent`**: Refactor `ClarificationAgent` to parse LLM responses to `clarify_objectives` and dynamically update `self.clarification_todo` based on actual clarification outcomes. Consider structured LLM output (e.g., JSON) for this.
-   [ ] **Functional `DebuggingAgent`**: Implement a functional `DebuggingAgent` that can:
    -   [ ] Receive system context, logs, and error messages.
    -   [ ] Analyze issues using LLM capabilities or predefined rules.
    -   [ ] Suggest actionable solutions or debugging steps.
    -   [ ] (Future) Integrate with shell commands or other tools for diagnostics.
-   [ ] **Detailed `QualityAssuranceAgent`**: Implement concrete `review_content` logic in `QualityAssuranceAgent` based on defined criteria. This should involve LLM-based evaluation and potentially flag content for human review.
-   [ ] **Robust Prompt Handling**: Implement mechanisms to ensure LLM outputs adhere to expected formats and content, including output parsing, validation, and re-prompting if necessary.

### 2.2 Agent Autonomy and Tool Use

-   [ ] **Agent-Tool Integration Framework**: Develop a framework that allows agents to:
    -   [ ] Access a registry of available tools (e.g., `internet_tool.py`, `file_manager.py`).
    -   [ ] Reason about when and how to use tools based on their task and LLM capabilities.
    -   [ ] Generate tool calls as part of their LLM response.
-   [ ] **Tool Execution Module**: Create a dedicated module to parse tool calls from LLM responses and execute the corresponding Python functions, feeding results back to the agent.
-   [ ] **Prompt Engineering for Tool Use**: Refine agent prompts to encourage LLMs to reason about and utilize tools effectively, including providing tool definitions and few-shot examples.
-   [ ] **Dynamic Task Execution**: Shift from hardcoded function calls to agents determining their own steps, including tool calls, based on their LLM reasoning.
-   [ ] **Agent State Management**: Ensure agents can maintain their internal state and context across multiple turns of interaction with the LLM and tool execution.

## Phase 3: Production Readiness & Optimization

### 3.1 Scalability and Cost Management

-   [ ] **LLM Call Optimization**: Implement strategies for token optimization (minimizing tokens sent/received) and efficient batching of requests.
-   [ ] **Model Selection Strategy**: Define a strategy for using smaller, cheaper Gemini models for simpler tasks where appropriate.
-   [ ] **Caching LLM Responses**: Implement a caching mechanism for repetitive LLM queries to reduce costs and latency.

### 3.2 Error Handling and Resilience

-   [ ] **Comprehensive Exception Handling**: Implement robust exception handling across all modules for LLM API errors, file I/O, and agent logic.
-   [ ] **Advanced Retry Mechanisms**: Implement advanced retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter for transient failures.
-   [ ] **Circuit Breakers**: Introduce circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures to external services.

### 3.3 Logging, Monitoring, and Security

-   [ ] **Structured Logging**: Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for all system activities, easily ingestible by log management systems.
-   [ ] **Metrics and Alerts**: Integrate with a monitoring system to collect metrics on agent performance, LLM usage, and error rates, and set up alerts for critical issues.
-   [ ] **Enhanced Security**: Beyond API key management, implement:
    -   [ ] Input validation and sanitization.
    -   [ ] Output sanitization to prevent malicious code or sensitive information leakage.
    -   [ ] Principle of Least Privilege for agent and tool access.

### 3.4 Performance and Testing

-   [ ] **Asynchronous Processing**: Explore and implement asynchronous processing for independent agent tasks to improve overall throughput.
-   [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**: Expand the testing suite to include:
    -   [ ] Unit tests for all new and refactored components.
    -   [ ] Integration tests for agent interactions and tool usage.
    -   [ ] End-to-end tests for the entire multi-agent workflow.
