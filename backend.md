# Ardi Agent Backend Design

This document outlines the backend design for a web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) personal notes.  The application will also include user authentication and authorization.

## Database Schema

The database will utilize a relational model (e.g., PostgreSQL).  The schema includes two tables:

* **users:**
    * `user_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT)
    * `username` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
    * `password_hash` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)  // Stored as a securely hashed value
    * `email` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

* **notes:**
    * `note_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT)
    * `user_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing users.user_id)
    * `title` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)
    * `content` (TEXT)
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)


## API Endpoints (RESTful)

The API will use standard RESTful principles with JSON responses.

* **Users:**
    * `/users/register`: POST - Register a new user (username, email, password).
    * `/users/login`: POST - Authenticate an existing user (username/email, password).
    * `/users/me`: GET - Retrieve the currently logged-in user's information (requires authentication).


* **Notes:**
    * `/notes`: GET - Retrieve all notes for the currently logged-in user (requires authentication).
    * `/notes`: POST - Create a new note (requires authentication).
    * `/notes/{note_id}`: GET - Retrieve a specific note (requires authentication).
    * `/notes/{note_id}`: PUT - Update a specific note (requires authentication).
    * `/notes/{note_id}`: DELETE - Delete a specific note (requires authentication).


## Authentication/Authorization Flow

* **Registration:**  The `/users/register` endpoint will hash the password using a strong, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before storing it in the database.
* **Login:** The `/users/login` endpoint will compare the provided password against the stored hash.  Upon successful authentication, a JWT (JSON Web Token) will be issued, containing the user ID and other relevant information.
* **Authorization:** All endpoints requiring authentication will validate the JWT in the Authorization header.  Access control will be based on the user ID in the JWT.


## Business Logic Implementation

The business logic will handle:

* **Password Hashing:** Securely hashing passwords during registration.
* **JWT Generation and Validation:** Generating and verifying JWTs for authentication.
* **Data Validation:** Ensuring that data submitted through API requests is valid and meets required constraints.
* **Data Sanitization:** Protecting against SQL injection and other vulnerabilities by properly sanitizing user inputs.
* **Note Creation, Update, and Deletion:** Implementing CRUD operations for notes with appropriate error handling.


## Error Handling

The API will return standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of requests.  Detailed error messages will be included in the response body for debugging purposes.  A logging system will record all errors and relevant information for monitoring and troubleshooting.


## Security and Scalability

* **Security:**  The application will utilize HTTPS, input validation, parameterized queries, and secure password storage to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.
* **Scalability:** The database will be properly indexed and optimized for performance.  The application will be designed to handle a large number of concurrent users and requests.  Consideration will be given to using a load balancer and caching strategies for improved scalability.
