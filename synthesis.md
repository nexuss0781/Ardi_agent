As the Synthesizer Agent, I have integrated and synthesized the content from `Idea.md` and `Analysis.md` to define the core additional task attributes for our task management web application's Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## **Synthesis: Task Attribute Features for MVP**

This document synthesizes the proposed task attributes from the Idea Generator with the market and competitor analysis from the Analysis Agent, providing a consolidated view for the MVP scope. The goal is to balance essential functionality with development feasibility, ensuring a robust yet manageable initial release.

### **1. Due Dates**

*   **Idea Proposed (Idea.md):** **YES.** Fundamental for tracking deadlines. Users should assign a specific date, optionally a time. Visual indication for overdue/due soon tasks. Tasks can exist without a due date.
*   **Analysis Insights (Analysis.md):** Universally offered by competitors (Todoist, Asana, Microsoft To Do). Considered "expected and essential." Key UX differentiator is natural language input (e.g., "tomorrow 3pm") and clear visual indicators.
*   **Synthesized MVP Requirement:** **ESSENTIAL.**
    *   Implement core functionality for assigning dates and optional times.
    *   Prioritize clear visual cues for upcoming and overdue tasks.
    *   While natural language input is a strong enhancement, it can be considered a post-MVP refinement if initial development resources are constrained, focusing first on a standard date/time picker.
    *   Ensure tasks can exist without a due date to support backlog items.

### **2. Priority Levels**

*   **Idea Proposed (Idea.md):** **YES.** Helps users focus. Implement High, Medium, Low. Use visual cues (color-coding, icons). Allow sorting and filtering.
*   **Analysis Insights (Analysis.md):** Most competitors offer some form of priority (e.g., Todoist's P1-P4, Asana's High/Medium/Low). "Essential for task management." Visual cues are common and effective. Acknowledged potential for user subjectivity ("everything high").
*   **Synthesized MVP Requirement:** **ESSENTIAL.**
    *   Implement a standard set of priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
    *   Crucially, incorporate distinct visual cues (e.g., color, icons) to allow for quick identification in task lists.
    *   Enable sorting and filtering tasks by priority.
    *   The system should be intuitive enough to encourage meaningful prioritization, even if users occasionally over-prioritize.

### **3. Categories or Tags**

*   **Idea Proposed (Idea.md):** **YES.** Offers significant flexibility for organization. Users create custom tags, assign multiple tags per task, and filter tasks by one or more tags.
*   **Analysis Insights (Analysis.md):** Widely adopted across competitors (e.g., Todoist's "Labels," Trello's "Labels"). "Essential for flexible organization and retrieval." More powerful than fixed categories. Potential con is "tag sprawl" if not managed well.
*   **Synthesized MVP Requirement:** **ESSENTIAL.**
    *   Develop robust functionality for creating and assigning custom tags.
    *   Allow multiple tags per task.
    *   Implement powerful filtering capabilities based on tags.
    *   Consider UI/UX elements that help users manage their tags effectively to mitigate "tag sprawl" (e.g., a dedicated tag management section, auto-suggest for existing tags).

### **4. Sub-tasks (and Attachments)**

*   **Idea Proposed (Idea.md):** **Sub-tasks: YES.** Crucial for breaking down large tasks. Nested sub-tasks with their own title, description, and status. For MVP, parent task status independent of sub-tasks, but UI shows progress. **Attachments: NO for initial MVP.**
*   **Analysis Insights (Analysis.md):** Sub-tasks are supported by all major competitors (Todoist, Asana). "Crucial for breaking down complex tasks." Deep nesting can lead to clutter. The proposed independent status for parent/sub-tasks is a good MVP approach to avoid complexity. Attachments introduce significant complexity (storage, security).
*   **Synthesized MVP Requirement:** **Sub-tasks: ESSENTIAL.** **Attachments: NOT for MVP.**
    *   Implement sub-task functionality allowing for nesting.
    *   Each sub-task must have its own title, description, and completion status.
    *   Crucially, maintain the proposed MVP approach where the parent task's completion status is independent of its sub-tasks, with the UI simply indicating sub-task progress. This simplifies initial development.
    *   Attachments are confirmed as a **Phase 2/3 feature** due to their inherent complexities.

### **5. Recurring Tasks**

*   **Idea Proposed (Idea.md):** **YES.** Highly valuable for routine activities. Support Daily, Weekly (specific days), Monthly (specific day/nth day), Yearly patterns. New instance generated on completion. Option for end date/occurrences.
*   **Analysis Insights (Analysis.md):** Common feature, especially in personal productivity tools. "Highly valuable." Acknowledged that complex recurrence patterns can be tricky to implement robustly (e.g., "every 3rd Tuesday, but skip holidays").
*   **Synthesized MVP Requirement:** **ESSENTIAL.**
