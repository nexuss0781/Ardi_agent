# Ardi Agent: Unified Design Document

This document synthesizes the backend and frontend designs for the Ardi Agent application, a web application featuring a note-taking system and a task management system.

## I. Backend Design (Note-Taking System)

The backend utilizes a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) with two tables: `users` and `notes`.  The `users` table stores user information including username, email, and a securely hashed password. The `notes` table stores user notes, linking to the `users` table via a foreign key (`user_id`).

**Database Schema:**

* **users:** `user_id` (INT, PK, AI), `username` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL), `password_hash` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL), `email` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP), `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
* **notes:** `note_id` (INT, PK, AI), `user_id` (INT, FK referencing users.user_id), `title` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL), `content` (TEXT), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP), `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

**API Endpoints (RESTful, JSON):**

* **Users:**
    * `/users/register` (POST): Register a new user.
    * `/users/login` (POST): Authenticate an existing user.  JWT issued upon success.
    * `/users/me` (GET): Retrieve currently logged-in user's information (requires authentication).

* **Notes:**
    * `/notes` (GET): Retrieve all notes for the currently logged-in user (requires authentication).
    * `/notes` (POST): Create a new note (requires authentication).
    * `/notes/{note_id}` (GET): Retrieve a specific note (requires authentication).
    * `/notes/{note_id}` (PUT): Update a specific note (requires authentication).
    * `/notes/{note_id}` (DELETE): Delete a specific note (requires authentication).


**Authentication/Authorization:** JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication.  Passwords are hashed using a strong one-way algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).

**Business Logic:** Includes password hashing, JWT generation/validation, data validation/sanitization, and CRUD operations for notes with error handling and logging.

**Security & Scalability:** HTTPS, input validation, parameterized queries, secure password storage, database indexing/optimization, load balancing, and caching will be implemented to ensure security and scalability.  Error handling uses standard HTTP status codes with detailed error messages in the response body.


## II. Frontend Design (Task Management System)

The frontend will be a task management application integrated with the note-taking backend. This will provide a cohesive user experience.


**UI/UX Design:**  Clean, minimalist design with a light color palette (#f4f4f4 background, #333 text, #4CAF50 complete task, #FF5722 due date warning), legible sans-serif font (Roboto or Open Sans), and responsive layout.  Subtle animations will enhance user interaction.

* **Homepage:** Displays a list of tasks organized by status (incomplete/complete), showing title, description (truncated), due date, and a completion checkbox.  Includes an "Add New Task" button.
* **Task Details View:** Allows editing task details (title, description, due date) with "Save Changes," "Delete Task," and "Cancel" buttons.

**Implementation Simulation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**  Uses Flexbox and Grid for layout, CSS transitions/keyframes for animations. JavaScript handles dynamic task management and interacts with the backend API.

**API Integration:**  The frontend will interact with the backend API using the following endpoints:

* `/api/tasks` (GET, POST): Retrieve/add tasks.
* `/api/tasks/{id}` (GET, PUT, DELETE): Retrieve/update/delete tasks.

## III. Synergy and Future Opportunities

The integration of the note-taking and task management systems within a single application offers significant synergy.  Users can seamlessly associate notes with tasks, enriching the task management experience.  Future development could include:

* **Task-Note Linking:**  Allow users to link notes to specific tasks for improved context and organization.
* **Advanced Search/Filtering:** Implement more sophisticated search and filtering capabilities across both notes and tasks.
* **Collaboration Features:** Allow multiple users to collaborate on tasks and notes.
* **Calendar Integration:** Integrate with a calendar application for better visualization of task deadlines.
* **Notification System:** Implement a notification system to remind users of upcoming deadlines.


This unified design provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive and user-friendly Ardi Agent application.  The integration of the note-taking and task management systems offers a powerful and versatile tool for users.
