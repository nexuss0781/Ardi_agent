Okay, I understand! This is an excellent approach to ensure we're aligned from the start. I will incorporate your clarifying questions into a comprehensive feature analysis document (`Idea.md`), outlining the proposed functionalities and technical considerations based on your initial prompt and the common needs of a personal task management application.

Here is the `Idea.md` document:

# Idea.md: Personal Task Management Application

## 1. Project Overview

A web-based personal task management application designed to help a single user efficiently organize and track their daily tasks. The core functionality revolves around CRUD operations for tasks, with essential attributes and intuitive viewing options.

## 2. User Definition & Authentication

*   **User Scope:** The application is designed for a **single, dedicated user account** for the *entire application instance*. This means only one individual will ever log in and use this specific deployment of the application.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   **Login:** A simple username/password authentication mechanism will be implemented.
    *   **Registration:** No public registration will be available. The single user account will be created by the administrator (or during initial setup).
    *   **Security:** Basic password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) and session management (e.g., JWT or server-side sessions) will be used to secure access.
    *   **Future Consideration:** While currently single-user, the architecture should ideally allow for future expansion to a multi-user system (where multiple individuals can sign up and manage their own tasks independently) without a complete re-write, if that becomes a requirement. This implies user IDs associated with tasks in the database schema.

## 3. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX)

*   **Design Philosophy:**
    *   **Minimalist & Clean:** Focus on clarity and ease of use. Avoid clutter.
    *   **Modern Aesthetic:** Utilize contemporary design principles (e.g., subtle shadows, clean typography, appropriate spacing).
    *   **Intuitive:** Task creation, editing, and viewing should be straightforward and require minimal clicks.
*   **Responsiveness:** The application **must be fully responsive**, adapting gracefully to various screen sizes, including:
    *   Desktop (large screens)
    *   Tablet (medium screens)
    *   Mobile (small screens)
*   **Key UI Elements:**
    *   **Task List View:** Primary display of tasks.
    *   **Task Creation Form:** Simple form for adding new tasks.
    *   **Task Detail/Edit View:** Dedicated view or modal for editing task details.
    *   **Navigation:** Minimal navigation (e.g., a simple sidebar or header for filters/settings).
    *   **Feedback:** Clear visual feedback for actions (e.g., task added, task deleted, validation errors).
*   **Theming:**
    *   **Default:** A light theme will be the default.
    *   **Optional:** A dark mode toggle would be a valuable enhancement for user preference.

## 4. Technology Stack (Proposed)

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** React, Vue.js, or Svelte. These offer component-based development, strong ecosystems, and excellent performance for single-page applications (SPAs). (Preference: React or Vue.js for broader community support).
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or Styled Components for efficient and maintainable styling.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Language/Framework:** Node.js with Express.js, or Python with Flask/Django. These are well-suited for building RESTful APIs, offer good performance, and have extensive libraries. (Preference: Node.js with Express.js for full-stack JavaScript synergy, or Python/Flask for rapid development).
*   **Database:**
    *   **Type:** Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
    *   **Choice:** PostgreSQL or SQLite.
        *   **PostgreSQL:** Robust, feature-rich, and scalable for potential future growth. Excellent for structured data.
        *   **SQLite:** Ideal for simpler, single-user deployments where a lightweight, file-based database is sufficient and easy to set up.
    *   **ORM:** Sequelize (for Node.js) or SQLAlchemy (for Python) for efficient database interaction.

## 5. Core Task Functionalities (CRUD)

*   **Create Task:**
    *   Ability to add a new task with all defined attributes.
    *   Validation on required fields (e.g., Task Name).
*   **Read/View Tasks:**
    *   Display a list of tasks.
    *   **Default View:** Tasks ordered by Due Date (soonest first) or creation date.
    *   **Task Details:** Clickable tasks to view/edit full details.
*   **Update Task:**
    *   Ability to modify any attribute of an existing task.
    *   Mark task as "Completed".
*   **Delete Task:**
    *   Ability to permanently remove a task.
    *   Confirmation prompt before deletion.

## 6. Task Attributes

Each task will possess the following attributes:

*   **Task Name (Required):** Short, descriptive title (e.g., "Buy groceries", "Finish report"). Max length: 255 characters.
*   **Description (Optional):** More detailed notes about the task. Supports multi-line text.
*   **Due Date (Optional):** A specific date by which the task should be completed.
    *   **Time:** Optionally, a specific time can be included with the due date.
*   **Priority (Optional):** Categorization of importance.
    *   **Types:** Low, Medium, High (or 1, 2, 3). Represented visually (e.g., color-coded).
*   **Status (Required):** The current state of the task.
    *   **Default Statuses:**
        *   `To Do` (Default for new tasks)
        *   `In Progress`
        *   `Completed`
        *   `Archived` (for tasks that are completed but not deleted, and not actively shown in main view)
    *   **Custom Statuses (Future Enhancement):** Consider allowing the user to define custom statuses beyond the defaults.
*   **Creation Date (Automatic):** Timestamp when the task was created.
*   **Last Updated Date (Automatic):** Timestamp when the task was last modified.

## 7. Task Viewing & Management

*   **Sorting:**
    *   Tasks can be sorted by:
        *   Due Date (Ascending/Descending)
        *   Priority (High to Low / Low to High)
        *   Creation Date (Newest first / Oldest first)
        *   Alphabetical (Task Name A-Z /
