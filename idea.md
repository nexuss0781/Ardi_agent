# Idea.md: Comprehensive Task Management Application Feature Analysis

This document outlines the conceptual features and requirements for a comprehensive web-based task management application, addressing the clarifications requested by the lead developer. The goal is to build a robust, scalable, and user-friendly system capable of handling diverse task management needs.

## 1. Core Application Vision

The application aims to provide individuals with a powerful, intuitive, and flexible tool to organize, track, and manage their personal and professional tasks efficiently. It will support a wide range of task types, offering advanced features for scheduling, organization, and tracking, along with flexible viewing and management options.

## 2. User Management

*   **Multi-User Support:** The application is explicitly designed for **multiple users**. Each user will have their own distinct and private task list, ensuring data segregation and personalized task management experiences.
*   **User Registration & Authentication:**
    *   **Registration:** Users will be able to create new accounts securely, typically using an email address and a strong password.
    *   **Login:** A secure login mechanism will be provided for registered users to access their personalized task dashboards.
    *   **Authentication:** Industry-standard authentication protocols (e.g., token-based authentication like JWT or secure session management) will be implemented to protect user data and maintain session integrity.
    *   **Password Management:** Features such as password reset (via email verification) and password change functionality will be included to enhance security and user convenience.

## 3. Data Persistence

*   **Database Solution:** For a comprehensive, scalable, and reliable application, a robust **relational database management system (RDBMS)** is essential.
    *   **Recommendation:** **PostgreSQL** is highly recommended.
    *   **Rationale:** PostgreSQL offers strong data integrity, advanced querying capabilities (including JSONB for flexible schema
