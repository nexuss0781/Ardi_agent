# Idea.md: Task Management Web Application Feature Analysis

This document outlines the core functionalities, user management scope, advanced features, and UI/UX considerations for a robust task management web application.

---

### **1. Core Functionality:**

*   **Task Creation:**
    Tasks should be created with the following essential fields, some of which may be automatically generated:
    *   **Title:** A concise, mandatory name for the task (e.g., "Prepare Q3 Report").
    *   **Description:** A rich-text field for detailed information, notes, and context (supports markdown for formatting).
    *   **Due Date:** An optional date and time by which the task should be completed.
    *   **Priority Level:** A selection from predefined levels (e.g., "Critical," "High," "Medium," "Low," "None"). Default to "Medium."
    *   **Status:** Initial status set to "To Do." (See "Task Status Management" for full list).
    *   **Assignee(s):** For multi-user environments, the ability to assign the task to one or more registered users within the same workspace/project. Defaults to the creator if not specified.
    *   **Project/Category:** An optional field to associate the task with a specific project or category (e.g., "Marketing Campaign," "Personal," "Development").
    *   **Tags:** Optional keywords for flexible categorization and filtering (e.g., "Urgent," "Client A," "Bug," "Research").
    *   **Creation Date:** Automatically recorded timestamp when the task is created.
    *   **Last Modified Date:** Automatically updated timestamp whenever any task detail is changed.
    *   **Created By:** Automatically recorded user who created the task.

*   **Task Viewing:**
    The application should offer multiple intuitive ways to view tasks to cater to different user preferences and workflows:
    *   **List View:** A simple, sortable, and filterable tabular or card-based list displaying key task details (title, due date, assignee, status, priority).
    *   **Kanban Board View:** Tasks displayed as cards organized into columns representing their current status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed"). Drag-and-drop functionality to change status.
    *   **Calendar View:** Tasks with due dates displayed on a daily, weekly, or monthly calendar. Clickable entries to view/edit task details.
    *   **Grouped Views:** Ability to group tasks dynamically by various criteria such as:
        *   By Status
        *   By Assignee
        *   By Project/Category
        *   By Due Date (e.g., "Today," "Tomorrow," "Upcoming," "Overdue," "No Due Date")
        *   By Priority

*   **Task Editing:**
    Yes, the ability to modify *all* task details (title, description, due date, priority, status, assignee, project/category, tags, attachments, subtasks) is required. Changes should update the "Last Modified Date."

*   **Task Deletion:**
    Yes, the ability to permanently remove tasks is required. A confirmation prompt should appear before deletion to prevent accidental removal. Optionally, a "soft delete" (archiving) feature could be considered for recovery.

*   **Task Status Management:**
    Tasks should progress through a defined set of statuses. The core statuses are:
    *   **To Do:** The task has been created and is awaiting commencement.
    *   **In Progress:** The task is currently being worked on.
    *   **Completed:** The task has been finished successfully.
    *   **Pending:** The task is awaiting an external action or information before it can proceed (e.g., awaiting client feedback).
    *   **Blocked:** The task cannot proceed due to an impediment (e.g., dependency on another task, technical issue). A field to specify the reason for blocking would be beneficial.
    *   **On Hold:** The task is temporarily paused, but not blocked by an external factor (e.g., deprioritized, waiting for internal approval).
    *   **Canceled:** The task has been abandoned and will not be completed.

### **2. User Management & Scope:**

*   **User Scope:**
    This application is intended to support **multiple users**. This allows for team collaboration and personal task management within the same system.

*   **User Authentication:**
    Yes, **user authentication** will be required. This includes:
    *   **Registration:** Users can sign up for an account.
    *   **Login/Logout:** Secure access to user-specific data.
    *   **Password Management:** Ability to reset forgotten passwords.
    *   **User Profiles:** Basic user information (name, email).

*   **Task Sharing & Collaboration:**
    Yes, users will need to share tasks and collaborate on projects. This will be facilitated through:
    *   **Workspaces/Teams/Organizations:** Users can create or join specific workspaces (e.g., "Marketing Team," "Project X Development") which act as containers for shared projects and tasks.
    *   **Project-Based Sharing:** Tasks are primarily shared within specific "Projects" or "Categories" that belong to a workspace. All members of a project can view, edit, and comment on tasks within that project (with potential role-based permissions).
    *   **Assigning Tasks:** Users can assign tasks to other members within their shared workspace/project.
    *   **Commenting:** Ability for users to add comments to tasks for discussion and updates.
    *   **Activity Log:** A chronological record of changes and comments made on a task.

        *   Tags
        *   Creation Date (custom range)
        *   Last Modified Date (custom range)
        *   Tasks with attachments
        *   Tasks with subtasks

*   **Sorting:**
    Ability to sort tasks in ascending or descending order by:
    *   Due Date
    *   Priority Level
    *   Creation Date
    *   Last Modified Date
    *   Title (alphabetical)
    *   Assignee

*   **Reminders/Notifications:**
    The application should provide timely reminders and notifications:
    *   **In-app Notifications:** A notification center within the application for upcoming due dates, task assignments, comments, and status changes.
    *   **Email Notifications:** Optional email notifications for critical events (e.g., task assigned, due date approaching/overdue, task commented on).
    *   **Custom Reminder Times:** Users should be able to set custom reminder times for individual tasks (e.g., 1 hour before, 1 day before, custom date/time).

*   **Subtasks/Checklists:**
    Yes, the ability to break down a main task into smaller, manageable sub-components.
    *   Each subtask can have its own title and a checkbox for completion.
    *   Subtasks contribute to the overall progress of the parent task (e.g., a progress bar on the parent task).
    *   Subtasks are typically simpler than full tasks and may not have all the fields of a main task (e.g., no separate due date, assignee, or priority, inheriting from parent).

*   **Recurring Tasks:**
    Yes, the ability to set tasks that repeat automatically based on a defined schedule:
    *   **Frequency:** Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly.
    *   **Custom Intervals:** Every N days/weeks/months/years.
    *   **Specific Days of Week/Month:** E.g., every Monday and Wednesday; on the 1st and 15th of the month.
