# Idea.md: Task Management Web Application - Feature Analysis

Based on the clarified requirements, the following features are proposed for the task management web application:

## I. Core Functionalities

*   **User Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Secure user registration and login using email and password.
    *   Password reset functionality.
    *   Integration with OAuth 2.0 providers (Google, GitHub) for optional login.
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) for granular permission management (see Section IV).
*   **Task Management:**
    *   Task creation with title, description, assigned user, due date, and status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed, Blocked).
    *   Task editing and deletion.
    *   Task searching and filtering by various criteria (title, status, due date, assignee).
    *   Ability to assign tasks to multiple users.
    *   Option to set task priority (high, medium, low).
    *   Status updates with timestamps.
*   **Project Management (Optional):**
    *   Creation of projects to group related tasks.
    *   Ability to assign tasks to specific projects.
    *   Project overview dashboard showing tasks within each project.


## II. Advanced Features

*   **Recurring Tasks:**
    *   Option to create tasks that repeat at specified intervals (daily, weekly, monthly).
    *   Customizable repeat patterns and end dates.
*   **Collaboration Tools:**
    *   Commenting system for tasks allowing for discussions and updates.
    *   Task notifications (email and/or in-app) for updates, due dates, and task assignments.
*   **Reporting and Analytics:**
    *   Basic reports on overdue tasks, tasks per user, and project completion progress.
    *   Visual representations of task status and progress (e.g., Gantt charts, Kanban boards -  consider MVP first).
*   **File Attachments:**
    *   Option to attach relevant files to tasks.
*   **Subtasks:**
    *   Ability to break down tasks into smaller subtasks.
    *   Tracking subtask completion.


## III. Potential Integrations

*   **Calendar Integration:**
    *   Display tasks on a calendar view, allowing for scheduling and visual representation of deadlines.
*   **Third-Party Notification Services:**
    *   Send task notifications via popular services like Slack or Microsoft Teams.


## IV. User Roles and Permissions

*   **Administrator:** Full access to all application features, including user management and system configuration.
*   **Project Manager:** Ability to create and manage projects, assign tasks, view reports, and manage team members within their projects.
*   **Team Member:** Ability to view assigned tasks, create and update task details, and contribute to task discussions.

Permissions will be defined based on roles.  Administrators have the highest level of permissions, followed by project managers, and then team members.


## V. Technology Stack

*   Frontend: React.js (or Vue.js as alternative)
*   Backend: Node.js with Express.js (or similar framework)
*   Database: PostgreSQL


## VI. UI/UX

*   Clean, intuitive and modern design.
*   Focus on ease of use and task management efficiency.
*   Responsive design for optimal viewing across devices.
