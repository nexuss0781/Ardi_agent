# Idea.md: Comprehensive Feature Analysis for Web-Based Task Management Application

This document outlines a comprehensive feature analysis for the proposed web-based task management application, addressing the ambiguities and requirements highlighted in the initial request. This serves as a conceptual blueprint for design and development.

---

## 1. Task Definition & Attributes:

*   **Essential Attributes:**
    *   **Title (Required):** A concise name for the task. (e.g., "Prepare Q3 Report")
    *   **Description (Optional):** Detailed information about the task. Supports rich text formatting (bold, italics, lists, links).
    *   **Due Date (Optional):** The deadline for the task. Includes date and optional time.
    *   **Priority Level (Optional):** Categorization of importance (e.g., High, Medium, Low, Critical). Default to Medium.
    *   **Status (Required):** The current state of the task.
        *   **Core Statuses (MVP):** 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Completed'.
        *   **Extended Statuses (Comprehensive):** 'On Hold', 'Blocked', 'Archived'.
*   **Other Required Fields:**
    *   **Category/Tags (Optional):** User-defined labels for grouping and filtering tasks (e.g., 'Marketing', 'Development', 'Personal', 'Urgent'). Multiple tags per task.
    *   **Estimated Time (Optional):** Numerical value representing the estimated effort (e.g., in hours, days).
    *   **Assigned User (Optional, if multi-user):** The user responsible for completing the task.
    *   **Creation Date (System Generated):** Timestamp when the task was created.
    *   **Last Modified Date (System Generated):** Timestamp of the last update to the task.
*   **Subtasks / Hierarchical Task Structures:**
    *   **MVP:** Not required for the initial MVP. Tasks are flat.
    *   **Comprehensive:** **Yes, necessary.** Support for subtasks, allowing a task to have nested tasks. A parent task's completion could be dependent on its subtasks. This would enable complex project breakdown.
*   **Recurring Tasks:**
    *   **MVP:** Not required.
    *   **Comprehensive:** **Yes, required.** Ability to set tasks to recur at specified intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, custom intervals). This would involve generating new instances of the task based on the recurrence pattern.

## 2. User Management & Collaboration:

*   **Multi-user Support:** **Yes, multi-user support with user accounts is needed.**
    *   **Registration:** Users can sign up with email/password.
    *   **Login:** Secure authentication.
    *   **Authentication:** Standard token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
    *   **Password Reset:** Functionality for forgotten passwords.
*   **Collaborative Task Management:** **Yes, required for a comprehensive solution.**
    *   **Task Assignment:** Tasks can be assigned to one or more registered users.
    *   **Sharing Task Lists/Projects:** Users can create and share entire task lists or "projects" with other users, granting different levels of access (e.g., view-only, editor, admin).
    *   **Commenting:** Users can add comments to tasks, fostering communication and discussion directly within the task context. Comments should support basic text and timestamps.
    *   **Activity Log (Comprehensive):** A log of changes made to a task (e.g., "John changed status from To Do to In Progress," "Jane added a comment").

## 3. Core Management Functionalities (CRUD+):

*   **Creation:**
    *   **Simple Form (MVP):** A dedicated form for adding new tasks with all relevant attributes.
    *   **Quick Add (MVP):** A minimalist input field (e.g., at the top of a list) allowing users to quickly enter a task title, with optional quick-select for due date or assignee. Full details can be added later via editing.
*   **Viewing/Listing:**
    *   **List View (MVP):** Default view, displaying tasks in a tabular or card-like format, showing key attributes (title, due date, priority, status, assignee).
    *   **Kanban Board (MVP):** Visual representation of tasks as cards moving through different status columns (e.g., 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Completed'). Ideal for workflow visualization.
    *   **Calendar View (Comprehensive):** Tasks displayed on a calendar, based on their due dates. Allows for daily, weekly, and monthly views.
    *   **Filtering:** By status, priority, due date range, category/tags, assigned user, creation date.
    *   **Sorting:** By due date (ascending/descending), priority (high to low/low to high), title (alphabetical), creation date.
    *   **Search:** Global search functionality across task titles and descriptions.
*   **Updating:**
    *   **Dedicated Edit Form:** Clicking on a task opens a detailed form for modifying all attributes.
    *   **In-line Editing:** For quick changes to common attributes like title, status, or priority directly from the list/Kanban view.
*   **Deletion:**
    *   **Soft Delete (Recommended):** Tasks are marked as deleted but retained in the database for potential restoration.
    *   **Permanent Delete (Admin/User Option):** Option to permanently remove tasks from the system, typically after a grace period or from a "Trash" section. Confirmation required.
*   **Additional Actions:**
    *   **Completion:** Marking a task as 'Completed'. This should visually distinguish completed tasks (e.g., strikethrough, move to a 'Completed' section).
    *   **Archiving:** Moving tasks to an archive state, removing them from active views but retaining them for historical reference. Archived tasks can be unarchived.
    *   **Deferring:** Postponing a task's due date to a later time.
    *   **Restoring:** Bringing a soft-deleted or archived task back to an active state.

## 4. Notifications & Reminders:

*   **In-app Notifications (MVP):**
    *   For due dates (e.g., "Task 'X' is due today/tomorrow").
    *   For task assignments (e.g., "You have been assigned task 'Y'").
    *   For status changes on tasks the user is involved in (e.g., "Task 'Z' status changed to 'In Progress'").
    *   For new comments on tasks the user is following/assigned to.
*   **Email Notifications (Comprehensive):**
    *   Configurable email reminders for due dates.
    *   Email alerts for task assignments and significant status changes.
    *   Daily/weekly digest emails summarizing upcoming tasks or recent activity.
*   **Push Notifications (Future Consideration/Comprehensive):** For mobile clients, if developed.

## 5. Data Persistence:

*   **Database for Multi-user/Complex Data:** **A robust database is essential.**
    *   **Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):** Highly recommended due to the structured nature of tasks, users, and potential relationships (subtasks, comments). Provides strong data integrity and ACID properties.
    *   **Cloud-hosted Database Service:** For scalability and ease of management (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database).
*   **Backend API:** A RESTful or GraphQL API will mediate between the frontend and the database, handling business logic, authentication, and data retrieval/manipulation.

## 6. User Interface & Experience:

*   **UI/UX Preferences:**
    *   **Minimalist & Clean:** Focus on clarity and ease of use, reducing visual clutter.
    *   **Highly Visual:** Especially for Kanban and Calendar views, leveraging color coding (e.g., by priority, status) and clear visual indicators.
    *   **Mobile-Responsive:** The application must be fully functional and aesthetically pleasing on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). This is a **must-have**.
    *   **Intuitive Navigation:** Clear pathways to different sections (tasks, projects, settings).
    *   **Consistent Design Language:** Use of a modern UI framework (e.g., Material Design, Ant Design, Bootstrap) to ensure consistency and a professional look.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** **Yes, highly desired and a must-have for a good UX.**
    *   **Task Reordering:** Within lists, allowing users to manually order tasks.
    *   **Status Changes (Kanban):** Dragging task cards between columns on the Kanban board to update their status.
    *   **Subtask Management (Comprehensive):** Dragging tasks to nest them as subtasks under a parent task.

## 7. Scope & Priority:

*   **Intended Scope:** This is intended as a **comprehensive, feature-rich solution** over time, but with a clear **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)** for initial release.
*   **Absolute Must-Have Features (MVP for Initial Release):**
    *   **User Management:** Registration, Login, Authentication (multi-user).
    *   **Core Task Attributes:** Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Status, Category/Tags, Assigned User.
    *   **CRUD for Tasks:** Create (simple form & quick add), View (List View, Kanban Board), Update (dedicated form & in-line editing), Soft Delete.
    *   **Filtering, Sorting, Search:** Basic capabilities for tasks.
    *   **Task Completion & Archiving.**
    *   **In-app Notifications:** For due dates and assignments.
