# Idea.md: Comprehensive Feature Analysis for Task Management Web Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive feature analysis for a web-based task management application. It details the core functionalities, specific task attributes, user interface considerations, data persistence strategy, and advanced features, incorporating clarifications received regarding initial requirements and future-proofing. The goal is to provide a clear blueprint for development, ensuring all critical aspects are considered from the outset.

## 2. Core Application Goals

The primary objective of this application is to provide users with a robust and intuitive platform for managing their tasks effectively. This includes:

*   **Task Management:** Full Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for tasks.
*   **Rich Task Attributes:** Support for essential and advanced task details.
*   **Intuitive User Interface:** A user-friendly graphical interface accessible via web browsers.
*   **Data Persistence:** Reliable storage of all task data.
*   **Future-Proofing:** Design considerations for potential future enhancements like multi-user support.

## 3. Architectural & Design Considerations (Based on Clarifications)

Based on the clarifications, the following foundational decisions have been made for the initial development:

*   **Database Technology:** **PostgreSQL** will be the preferred relational database management system. It offers robustness, scalability, and a rich feature set suitable for complex data relationships.
*   **Multi-User Design:** The application's database schema and architecture **will be designed with multi-user support in mind** from the beginning. This means including fields like `user_id` on tasks (even if initially defaulting to a single user) to facilitate smoother future expansion to authentication and multi-user environments without major refactoring.
*   **User Interface Responsiveness:** The application's GUI **will be fully optimized for responsiveness**, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers. A desktop-first approach will be used for initial layout, but full responsiveness will be a core requirement.
*   **Task Statuses:** For the initial version, the definitive list of task statuses will be: **'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Completed'**. The **default status for a newly created task will be 'To Do'**. Custom or additional statuses may be considered in future iterations.
*   **UI Design Preferences:** The UI should aim for a **clean, intuitive, and modern minimalist design**. Emphasis will be on usability and clarity, avoiding unnecessary clutter.

## 4. Feature Breakdown

### 4.2. Task Attributes

Each task will support the following attributes:

#### 4.2.1. Title (Mandatory)
*   A concise and descriptive name for the task.
*   Maximum length: e.g., 255 characters.

#### 4.2.2. Description (Optional)
*   Detailed information about the task.
*   Supports multi-line text.
*   Consider rich text formatting (e.g., Markdown) for future iterations.

#### 4.2.3. Status (Predefined)
*   Indicates the current state of the task.
*   **Initial Statuses:** 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Completed'.
*   Default for new tasks: 'To Do'.

#### 4.2.4. Due Date (Optional)
*   A specific date by which the task should be completed.
*   Calendar picker for easy selection.
*   Ability to clear the due date.

#### 4.2.5. Priority (Optional)
*   An indicator of the task's importance or urgency.
*   **Levels:** e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical.
*   Default: Medium or None.

#### 4.2.6. Tags/Categories (Optional)
*   Allows users to categorize tasks for better organization and filtering.
*   Users can assign multiple tags to a task.
*   Ability to create, manage, and delete tags.

#### 4.2.7. Recurring Tasks (Detailed)
*   **Definition:** A task that automatically reappears after a specified interval or on specific days, generating new instances based on a defined pattern.
*   **Recurrence Pattern Options:**
    *   **None (Default):** A one-time task.
    *   **Daily:**
        *   Every X days (e.g., every 1 day, every 3 days).
    *   **Weekly:**
        *   Every X weeks (e.g., every 1 week, every 2 weeks).
        *   On specific days of the week (e.g., every Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
    *   **Monthly:**
        *   Every X months (e.g., every 1 month, every 6 months).
        *   On a specific day of the month (e.g., 15th of the month).
        *   On the Nth [Day of Week] of the month (e.g., first Monday of the month, third Tuesday).
    *   **Annually:**
        *   Every X years (e.g., every 1 year).
        *   On a specific month and day (e.g., January 1st).
*   **Start Date:** The date from which the recurrence pattern begins. The first instance will be generated on or after this date.
*   **End Condition:** Defines when the recurrence stops:
    *   **Never:** The task recurs indefinitely.
    *   **After X Occurrences:** The task recurs a set number of times.
    *   **On a Specific Date:** The task recurs until a specified end date.
*   **Generation Logic:**
    *   **Instance Creation:** New instances of a recurring task are typically generated automatically.
        *   Option 1: Generate the next instance upon completion of the current instance.
        *   Option 2: Proactively generate instances up to a certain future horizon (e.g., next 3 months).
    *   **Skipping Instances:** Ability to skip a single occurrence of a recurring task without affecting the overall recurrence pattern or future instances.
*   **Instance Management:**
    *   Each occurrence of a recurring task is treated as a distinct task instance with its own unique ID, status, due date, description, etc.
    *   **Propagation of Changes:**
        *   Changes made to the "parent" recurring task (e.g., title, recurrence pattern) should apply to *future* generated instances.
        *   Changes to specific attributes of an *already generated* instance (e.g., its status, its specific description) should only affect that instance and not the parent or other instances.
    *   **Deletion:**
        *   Ability to delete a single instance without deleting the entire recurring pattern.
        *   Ability to delete the entire recurring pattern, which should also delete all *future* generated instances.
*   **UI Considerations:**
    *   A clear interface within the task creation/edit form to define recurrence rules.
    *   Visual indicators on the task list to distinguish recurring tasks from one-time tasks.
    *   A way to view upcoming occurrences of a recurring task.

#### 4.2.8. Attachments (Optional)
*   Ability to upload and attach files (documents, images, etc.) relevant to the task.
*   Display attached files within the task detail view.
*   Consider file size limits and storage solutions.

#### 4.2.9. Subtasks/Checklists (Optional)
*   Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.
*   Each subtask can have its own status (e.g., checked/unchecked).
*   Progress indicator for the parent task based on subtask completion.

### 4.3. User Interface (GUI)

The application will feature a browser-accessible GUI designed for clarity and ease of use.

#### 4.3.1. Dashboard/Task List View
*   Primary view displaying all tasks.
*   Clear visual representation of task status, due dates, and priority.
*   Quick access to search, filter, and sort options.
*   Intuitive navigation (e.g., sidebar, header).

#### 4.3.2. Task Detail View
*   A dedicated page/modal for viewing and editing all attributes of a single task.
*   Includes description, subtasks, attachments, and recurrence details.

#### 4.3.3. Forms (Create/Edit)
*   User-friendly forms for adding and modifying tasks.
*   Input validation and clear error messages.
*   Date pickers for due dates.

#### 4.3.4. Responsiveness

*   Fluid layouts, responsive images, and media queries will be employed.

#### 4.3.5. Design Principles
