This document outlines the implementation roadmap for a task management web application, based on the integrated plan detailed in `Synthesis.md`.

## I. Project Overview

The goal is to develop a user-friendly, collaborative task management web application with a phased approach, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  The application will focus on intuitive design, seamless integration with popular communication tools, and a strong emphasis on user experience.

## II. Implementation Phases

The project will be implemented in three phases:

**Phase 1: MVP Development (4 weeks)**

* **Milestone 1 (Week 1):**  Setup development environment, implement basic user authentication and authorization (email/password).
* **Milestone 2 (Week 2):** Develop core task management functionalities (creation, editing, deletion, searching, filtering). Implement basic task status and priority.
* **Milestone 3 (Week 3):** Implement Kanban board functionality and basic commenting system.  Begin integration with Slack (notifications only).
* **Milestone 4 (Week 4):**  Complete Slack integration, implement file attachment functionality, and conduct thorough testing of the MVP.  Deploy to a staging environment.


**Phase 2: Post-MVP Enhancements (6 weeks)**

* **Milestone 5 (Week 5-6):** Implement advanced reporting and analytics (overdue tasks, tasks per user).  Develop recurring tasks functionality.  Begin Microsoft Teams integration.
* **Milestone 7 (Week 7-8):** Complete Microsoft Teams integration.  Explore and prototype AI-powered features (if feasible within timeframe).
* **Milestone 8 (Week 9-10):**  Conduct user testing and iterate based on feedback.  Address any critical bugs or performance issues.


**Phase 3: Further Development (Ongoing)**

* This phase will focus on expanding the application's capabilities based on user feedback and market demand.  Features include advanced reporting (Gantt charts), enhanced collaboration features (real-time co-editing), project management capabilities, and additional third-party integrations.


## III. Technology Stack

The following technology stack will be used for development:

* **Frontend:** React.js with Redux for state management.
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js framework.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Cloud Platform:** AWS (Considered for scalability and reliability)
* **Testing:** Jest, Cypress (unit and end-to-end testing)
* **Version Control:** Git with GitHub


## IV.  Risk Assessment & Mitigation

* **Integration Challenges:**  Integration with Slack and Microsoft Teams might pose challenges.  Mitigation:  Allocate sufficient time for integration and utilize their respective APIs effectively.
* **Scalability:**  Ensuring the application scales efficiently as the user base grows. Mitigation: Employ appropriate database design and cloud infrastructure (AWS).
* **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Protecting user data and preventing security breaches. Mitigation: Implement robust security measures throughout the development process, including secure authentication, input validation, and regular security audits.


## V. Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured plan for the development of the task management application.  The phased approach allows for iterative development, adaptation to user feedback, and effective risk management.

post_implementation_report = """# Post-Implementation Report: Task Management Web Application

This report summarizes the implemented features of the task management web application following the development phases outlined in the pre-implementation roadmap.

## I. Implemented Features

**Phase 1 (MVP):**

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Successful implementation of email/password based authentication. OAuth 2.0 integration with Google and GitHub is pending (Phase 2).  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is fully implemented for administrators and team members.
* **Task Management:**  All core task management functionalities are implemented, including creation, editing, deletion, searching, filtering, and status updates with timestamps.  Task priority is functional.
* **Collaboration Tools:**  A commenting system is fully functional. In-app notifications for task updates are implemented.  Integration with Slack for task notifications is complete.
* **Kanban Board:**  The Kanban board provides a visual representation of task status and progress, enhancing user experience and task management capabilities.
* **File Attachments:** Users can successfully attach files to tasks.

**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**

* **Advanced Reporting & Analytics:** Reports on overdue tasks and tasks per user are implemented.
* **Recurring Tasks:**  Recurring tasks functionality allows users to schedule tasks that repeat at set intervals.
* **Microsoft Teams Integration:**  Notifications are now sent to Microsoft Teams.  
*(Note: AI-powered features were not implemented in Phase 2 due to time constraints)*


## II. Technical Specifications

* **Frontend:** React.js with Redux.  Component library used: [List the library used].
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js.  API documentation is available at: [Link to API documentation].
* **Database:** PostgreSQL.  Database schema is documented in: [Link to Database schema documentation].
* **Deployment:** Deployed to [Deployment platform, e.g., AWS].
* **Testing:** Unit tests were implemented for the backend and frontend logic. End-to-end testing was done using Cypress.


## III.  Outstanding Issues and Future Work

* OAuth 2.0 integration (Google, GitHub) is still pending.
* AI-powered feature development should be prioritized.
* Further enhancements to reporting and analytics (Gantt charts, custom reports) should be planned for future releases.
* Mobile app development should be considered.


## IV. Conclusion

The core features of the task management web application have been successfully implemented, delivering a functional and user-friendly MVP.  Further development will focus on expanding features and improving the user experience based on feedback and the roadmap.
