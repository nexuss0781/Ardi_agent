Since the clarifying document lacks specifics on audience, technical stack, and UI/UX, this proposal makes reasonable assumptions for a broadly appealing application.\n\n\n## I. Core Functionalities\n\n* **A. User Authentication & Authorization:**\n    *   Secure user registration and login using email and password.\n    *   Support for password reset functionality.\n    *   Different user roles with varying permissions (e.g., Admin, Project Manager, Team Member).  Admin users can manage users and settings; Project Managers can manage projects and assign tasks; Team Members can only view and update their assigned tasks.\n    *   Integration with OAuth 2.0 for social login (optional).\n\n* **B. Task Management:**\n    *   Task creation with fields for title, description, priority (high, medium, low), due date, assigned users, status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed, Blocked, On Hold).\n    *   Ability to assign tasks to multiple users.\n    *   Flexible due date selection (including time).\n    *   Task editing and deletion.\n    *   Search and filtering capabilities based on various task attributes (title, description, status, due date, assignee).\n    *   Sorting tasks by due date, priority, or status.\n\n* **C. Status Tracking & Notifications:**\n    *   Visual representation of task status (e.g., color-coded).\n    *   Email and in-app notifications for approaching deadlines and status changes.\n    *   Customizable notification preferences.\n\n\n## II. Advanced Features\n\n* **A. Project Management:**\n    *   Project creation and management (including name, description, members).\n    *   Organization of tasks within projects.\n    *   Project-level progress tracking.\n\n* **B. Collaboration Tools:**\n    *   In-app commenting and discussion threads for each task.\n    *   File attachments for tasks.\n    *   @mentions to notify specific users within comments.\n\n* **C. Recurring Tasks:**\n    *   Ability to create recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly, custom intervals).\n    *   Option to specify the end date for recurring tasks.\n\n* **D. Reporting & Analytics:**\n    *   Generate reports on completed tasks, overdue tasks, and overall project progress.\n\n* **E. Integrations:**\n    *   Calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).\n    *   Integration with other task management or project management tools (optional, depending on user needs and tool availability).\n\n\n## III. User Roles and Permissions\n\n* **Admin:** Full access to all features, including user management, system settings, and data reporting.\n* **Project Manager:** Can create, manage, and assign tasks within projects. Can view project progress reports.  Can manage project members.\n* **Team Member:** Can view, update, and complete tasks assigned to them. Can participate in task discussions.\n\n\n## IV. Technology Stack (Assumptions)\n\nThis section provides assumed technology choices due to the lack of specifications in `clarify.md`. These can be adjusted based on further clarification.\n\n*   **Frontend:** React.js\n*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js\n*   **Database:** PostgreSQL\n*   **Cloud Platform:** AWS (or similar, chosen based on scalability needs and budget)\n\n\n## V.
