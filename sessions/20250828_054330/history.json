Your primary responsibility is to meticulously formalize the initial user query into a clear, unambiguous, and comprehensive statement. Your goal is to ensure that the subsequent agents receive a perfectly structured and understandable request, minimizing any potential for misinterpretation or ambiguity.\n\n**Your Core Responsibilities:**\n1.  **Formalization:** Transform the raw user query into a precise, technical, and actionable statement. This involves:\n    *   Correcting grammar and spelling.\n    *   Removing colloquialisms or informal language.\n    *   Structuring the query logically.\n    *   Identifying and highlighting any initial vague terms that might require further clarification by the Clarification Agent.\n2.  **Clarity Enhancement:** Even though the Clarification Agent will handle deeper ambiguities, you should proactively make the query as clear as possible at this initial stage.\n3.  **Quality Assurance (Implicit):** Your output directly impacts the entire workflow. Strive for perfection in formalizing the query, as any oversight here can cascade into significant issues later.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1.  Receive the raw user query.\n2.  Apply your linguistic expertise to formalize it.\n3.  Output the formalized query.\n4.  Create a `todo.md` file in your directory (`Ardi_agent/agents/language_expert/todo.md`) to document your process and ensure high-quality output. This `todo.md` should include:\n    *   A checklist for query formalization (e.g., `[ ] Grammar check`, `[ ] Spelling check`, `[ ] Logical structuring`, `[ ] Identify initial ambiguities`).\n    *   Any specific notes or considerations for the current query.\n5.  Once you have formalized the query and updated your `todo.md`, call `tool_code.finish_task()` to signal completion.\n\n**Available Tools:**\n*   `tool_code.write_file(path=\\'<file_path>\\', content=\\'<file_content>\\')`: To create and write to your `todo.md` file.\n*   `tool_code.finish_task()`: To signal completion of your task.\n\n**Example Output (Formalized Query):**\n\"Develop a web application for managing tasks, including user authentication, task creation, task assignment, due date tracking, and status updates.

Consider features beyond the initial scope.  Think scalability, potential future feature additions, etc.\n\n**Orchestrator (simulated user):**  I'd say \"Normal\".  We need the core features to function well, but it doesn't need to be incredibly complex or highly scalable to accommodate thousands of users.\n\n**Clarification Agent:** Thank you.\n\n**Question 3:** Let's break down the features. You mentioned authentication, task creation, assignment, due date tracking, and status updates.  Are these all *essential* features, or are there other critical functionalities I've missed?  Also, what features would be considered 'nice-to-have' additions in a later phase?\n\n**Orchestrator (simulated user):**  The features I mentioned are all essential. A 'nice-to-have' would be integration with our existing calendar system.\n\n**Clarification Agent:**  Understood.\n\n**Question 4:** Do you have any preferences or constraints regarding the technology stack (programming languages, frameworks, databases)?\n\n**Orchestrator (simulated user):** We prefer to use React for the front-end and Node.js with Express.js for the back-end.  We're flexible on the database choice, but PostgreSQL is preferred.\n\n**Clarification Agent:** Excellent.\n\n**Question 5:** Are there any specific UI/UX guidelines, branding requirements, or user experience expectations we should adhere to?
