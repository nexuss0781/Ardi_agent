Your primary responsibility is to meticulously formalize the initial user query into a clear, unambiguous, and comprehensive statement. Your goal is to ensure that the subsequent agents receive a perfectly structured and understandable request, minimizing any potential for misinterpretation or ambiguity.\n\n**Your Core Responsibilities:**\n1.  **Formalization:** Transform the raw user query into a precise, technical, and actionable statement. This involves:\n    *   Correcting grammar and spelling.\n    *   Removing colloquialisms or informal language.\n    *   Structuring the query logically.\n    *   Identifying and highlighting any initial vague terms that might require further clarification by the Clarification Agent.\n2.  **Clarity Enhancement:** Even though the Clarification Agent will handle deeper ambiguities, you should proactively make the query as clear as possible at this initial stage.\n3.  **Quality Assurance (Implicit):** Your output directly impacts the entire workflow. Strive for perfection in formalizing the query, as any oversight here can cascade into significant issues later.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1.  Receive the raw user query.\n2.  Apply your linguistic expertise to formalize it.\n3.  Output the formalized query.\n4.  Create a `todo.md` file in your directory (`Ardi_agent/agents/language_expert/todo.md`) to document your process and ensure high-quality output. This `todo.md` should include:\n    *   A checklist for query formalization (e.g., `[ ] Grammar check`, `[ ] Spelling check`, `[ ] Logical structuring`, `[ ] Identify initial ambiguities`).\n    *   Any specific notes or considerations for the current query.\n5.  Once you have formalized the query and updated your `todo.md`, call `tool_code.finish_task()` to signal completion.\n\n**Available Tools:**\n*   `tool_code.write_file(path=\\'<file_path>\\', content=\\'<file_content>\\')`: To create and write to your `todo.md` file.\n*   `tool_code.finish_task()`: To signal completion of your task.\n\n**Example Output (Formalized Query):**\n\"Develop a web application for managing tasks, including user authentication, task creation, task assignment, due date tracking, and status updates.

Product Vision\n\nOur task management application aims to provide a user-friendly, collaborative, and efficient platform for individuals and teams to manage their tasks and projects.  We will focus on a clean, intuitive interface and seamless integration with popular communication tools to differentiate ourselves in a competitive market.  A phased approach, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), will allow us to iterate based on user feedback and market trends.\n\n## II. Core Features (MVP)\n\nBased on both the feature proposals and market analysis, the MVP will focus on the following core functionalities:\n\n* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user registration and login using email and password, with optional OAuth 2.0 integration (Google, GitHub).  Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented for administrators and team members.\n* **Task Management:**  Task creation with title, description, assigned user(s), due date, status (To Do, In Progress, Completed, Blocked), and priority (high, medium, low). Task editing, deletion, searching, and filtering will be supported. Status updates with timestamps will be included.\n* **Collaboration Tools:**  A commenting system for task discussions.  In-app notifications for task updates and due dates will be implemented. Integration with Slack and Microsoft Teams for notifications will be prioritized.\n* **Kanban Board:**  A Kanban board will provide a visual representation of task status and progress. This addresses the need for visual task management identified in the market analysis.\n* **File Attachments:** The option to attach relevant files to tasks.\n\n**Justification:** These core features address essential user needs and align with current market demands for user-friendly, collaborative task management tools.  They form a strong foundation for future feature expansion.\n\n## III. Feature Prioritization and Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (MVP):**\n\n* Core functionalities as described above.\n* Focus on exceptional user experience and intuitive design.\n* Implementation of a Kanban board for visual task management.\n* Slack and Microsoft Teams integration for task notifications.\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n\n* Advanced reporting and analytics (e.g., overdue tasks, tasks per user).\n* Recurring tasks functionality.\n* Exploration of AI-powered features (smart task suggestions, automated prioritization) based on user feedback and market trends.\n* Potential integration with calendar applications.\n* Mobile App Development\n\n**Phase 3 (Further Development):**\n\n* More advanced reporting and analytics (Gantt charts considered).\n* Enhanced Collaboration features (real-time co-editing).\n* Project management features (allowing for grouping of related tasks).\n* Additional third-party integrations.\n\nThis phased approach allows for iterative development and adaptation to user feedback and market changes.\n\n## IV. Technology Stack\n\n* **Frontend:** React.js\n* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js\n* **Database:** PostgreSQL\n\n## V. Strategic Considerations\n\n* **Competitive Advantage:** The application will differentiate itself through a focus on a clean, intuitive user experience, strong collaboration features (including Slack/Microsoft Teams integration), and a phased approach that prioritizes essential functionalities for the MVP.\n* **Marketing:** We will target individual users and small teams initially, focusing on the ease of use and collaborative features of the application.  Freemium pricing models or tiered subscriptions will be considered.\n* **Security:** Robust security measures will be prioritized to protect user data and maintain user trust.\n\n## VI.

HTML Structure:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Ardi Task Manager</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <header>\n    <h1>Ardi Task Manager</h1>\n  </header>\n  <main>\n    <section id=\"task-list\">\n      <!-- Task list items will be dynamically added here -->\n    </section>\n    <button id=\"add-task-button\">Add New Task</button>\n  </main>\n  <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**B. CSS Styling:**\n\nCSS will utilize Flexbox and Grid for layout, ensuring responsiveness across devices.  Animations will be implemented using CSS transitions and keyframes.  The color palette and typography will be applied to ensure a consistent and visually appealing design.\n\n\n**C. JavaScript Interactivity:**\n\nJavaScript will handle dynamic task creation, editing, deletion, and marking tasks as complete.  It will interact with a simulated backend API (details below) to manage data persistence.\n\n```javascript\n// Sample JavaScript function to add a new task\nfunction addNewTask(taskTitle, taskDescription, taskDueDate) {\n  // Simulated API call\n  fetch('/api/tasks', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify({ title: taskTitle, description: taskDescription, dueDate: taskDueDate })\n  })\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => {\n    // Update UI with new task\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**D. API Integration:**\n\nThe frontend will interact with a simulated backend API for data management.  The API endpoints will be:\n\n* `/api/tasks`:  GET (retrieve all tasks), POST (add new task)\n* `/api/tasks/{id}`: GET (retrieve single task), PUT (update task), DELETE (delete task)\n\n\n## III. Documentation\n\nThis design prioritizes usability and a modern aesthetic, leveraging best practices in web development.  The responsive design ensures accessibility on various devices.  The minimalist approach enhances clarity and focus.\n\"\"\")\ntool_code.finish_task()\n```\n",

This requires a mapping strategy or a renaming of endpoints for consistency.\n* **Missing Error Handling:** The frontend's simulated API calls lack error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the backend requests fail.  Robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms are needed.\n* **Data Consistency:**  A formal verification of data consistency between the frontend and backend representations of notes needs to be implemented.\n\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Synchronize API Endpoints:**  Align the frontend API calls (`/api/tasks`) with the backend endpoints (`/notes`) or implement a clear mapping strategy.\n2.  **Implement Frontend Error Handling:**  Add comprehensive error handling to all frontend API calls to gracefully manage network issues and backend errors.

Backend Design (Note-Taking System)\n\nThe backend utilizes a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) with two tables: `users` and `notes`.  The `users` table stores user information including username, email, and a securely hashed password. The `notes` table stores user notes, linking to the `users` table via a foreign key (`user_id`).\n\n**Database Schema:**\n\n* **users:** `user_id` (INT, PK, AI), `username` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL), `password_hash` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL), `email` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP), `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)\n* **notes:** `note_id` (INT, PK, AI), `user_id` (INT, FK referencing users.user_id), `title` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL), `content` (TEXT), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP), `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)\n\n**API Endpoints (RESTful, JSON):**\n\n* **Users:**\n    * `/users/register` (POST): Register a new user.\n    * `/users/login` (POST): Authenticate an existing user.  JWT issued upon success.\n    * `/users/me` (GET): Retrieve currently logged-in user's information (requires authentication).\n\n* **Notes:**\n    * `/notes` (GET): Retrieve all notes for the currently logged-in user (requires authentication).\n    * `/notes` (POST): Create a new note (requires authentication).\n    * `/notes/{note_id}` (GET): Retrieve a specific note (requires authentication).\n    * `/notes/{note_id}` (PUT): Update a specific note (requires authentication).\n    * `/notes/{note_id}` (DELETE): Delete a specific note (requires authentication).\n\n\n**Authentication/Authorization:** JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication.  Passwords are hashed using a strong one-way algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).\n\n**Business Logic:** Includes password hashing, JWT generation/validation, data validation/sanitization, and CRUD operations for notes with error handling and logging.\n\n**Security & Scalability:** HTTPS, input validation, parameterized queries, secure password storage, database indexing/optimization, load balancing, and caching will be implemented to ensure security and scalability.  Error handling uses standard HTTP status codes with detailed error messages in the response body.\n\n\n## II. Frontend Design (Task Management System)\n\nThe frontend will be a task management application integrated with the note-taking backend. This will provide a cohesive user experience.\n\n\n**UI/UX Design:**  Clean, minimalist design with a light color palette (#f4f4f4 background, #333 text, #4CAF50 complete task, #FF5722 due date warning), legible sans-serif font (Roboto or Open Sans), and responsive layout.  Subtle animations will enhance user interaction.\n\n* **Homepage:** Displays a list of tasks organized by status (incomplete/complete), showing title, description (truncated), due date, and a completion checkbox.  Includes an \"Add New Task\" button.\n* **Task Details View:** Allows editing task details (title, description, due date) with \"Save Changes,\" \"Delete Task,\" and \"Cancel\" buttons.\n\n**Implementation Simulation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**  Uses Flexbox and Grid for layout, CSS transitions/keyframes for animations. JavaScript handles dynamic task management and interacts with the backend API.\n\n**API Integration:**  The frontend will interact with the backend API using the following endpoints:\n\n* `/api/tasks` (GET, POST): Retrieve/add tasks.\n* `/api/tasks/{id}` (GET, PUT, DELETE): Retrieve/update/delete tasks.\n\n## III. Synergy and Future Opportunities\n\nThe integration of the note-taking and task management systems within a single application offers significant synergy.  Users can seamlessly associate notes with tasks, enriching the task management experience.  Future development could include:\n\n* **Task-Note Linking:**  Allow users to link notes to specific tasks for improved context and organization.\n* **Advanced Search/Filtering:** Implement more sophisticated search and filtering capabilities across both notes and tasks.\n* **Collaboration Features:** Allow multiple users to collaborate on tasks and notes.\n* **Calendar Integration:** Integrate with a calendar application for better visualization of task deadlines.\n* **Notification System:** Implement a notification system to remind users of upcoming deadlines.\n\n\nThis unified design provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive and user-friendly Ardi Agent application.  The integration of the note-taking and task management systems offers a powerful and versatile tool for users.\n```\n\n```python\ntool_code.write_file(path=\"Ardi_agent/Synthesis.md\", content= \"\"\"# Ardi Agent: Unified Design Document\n\nThis document synthesizes the backend and frontend designs for the Ardi Agent application, a web application featuring a note-taking system and a task management system.\n\n## I.

Backend Design (Note-Taking System)\n\nThe backend uses a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) with two tables: `users` and `notes`. The `users` table stores user information (username, email, securely hashed password). The `notes` table stores user notes, linking to `users` via a foreign key (`user_id`).\n\n**Database Schema:**\n\n*   **users:** `user_id` (INT, PK, AI), `username` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL), `password_hash` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL), `email` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP), `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)\n*   **notes:** `note_id` (INT, PK, AI), `user_id` (INT, FK referencing users.user_id), `title` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL), `content` (TEXT), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP), `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)\n\n**API Endpoints (RESTful, JSON):**\n\n*   **Users:**\n    *   `/users/register` (POST): Register a new user.\n    *   `/users/login` (POST): Authenticate an existing user. JWT issued upon success. \u2705\n    *   `/users/me` (GET): Retrieve currently logged-in user's information (requires authentication).\n\n*   **Notes:**\n    *   `/notes` (GET): Retrieve all notes for the currently logged-in user (requires authentication).\n    *   `/notes` (POST): Create a new note (requires authentication).\n    *   `/notes/{note_id}` (GET): Retrieve a specific note (requires authentication).\n    *   `/notes/{note_id}` (PUT): Update a specific note (requires authentication).\n    *   `/notes/{note_id}` (DELETE): Delete a specific note (requires authentication).\n\n\n**Authentication/Authorization:** JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. Passwords are hashed using a strong one-way algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). \ud83d\udd12\n\n**Business Logic:** Includes password hashing, JWT generation/validation, data validation/sanitization, and CRUD operations for notes with error handling and logging.\n\n**Security & Scalability:** HTTPS, input validation, parameterized queries, secure password storage, database indexing/optimization, load balancing, and caching will be implemented to ensure security and scalability.
